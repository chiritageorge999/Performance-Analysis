## DAX Measures

This DAX function changes the title of the chart vizualization based on the selected value. There are similar functions for the report title, scatter plot, and waterfall vizuals.

```
_Column Chart title = SELECTEDVALUE(Slc_Values[Values]) & " YTD & PYTD | Month" 
```


This DAX function S_PYTD is designed to return a measure based on the selected value from a slicer.

```
S_PYTD = 
VAR selected_value = SELECTEDVALUE(Slc_Values[Values])
VAR result = SWITCH(selected_value,
    "Sales", [PYTD_Sales],
    "Quantity", [PYTD_Quantity],
    "Gross Profit", [PYTD_GrossProfit],
    BLANK()
)
RETURN
result
```

This DAX function is used to calculate the PriorYearToDate values of the Gross Profit. There are similar calculations for the Quantity and Sales dimensions.

```
PYTD_GrossProfit = 
CALCULATE(
    [Gross Profit],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_Date[Date]),
    Dim_Date[Inpast] = TRUE
)
```
